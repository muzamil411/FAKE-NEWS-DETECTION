<h1 style="text-align: center;">Fake News Detection Model</h1>

This project is focused on detecting fake news using a Logistic Regression model. The model has been trained on a dataset containing both true and false news articles. By providing a news headline or article as input, the model predicts whether the news is fake or real.

<h2>Features</h2>

- **Input**: News text (headline or article).
- **Output**: Prediction of whether the news is fake or real.
- **Model**: Logistic Regression
- **Libraries Used**:
  - **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **numpy**: For numerical operations.
  - **seaborn**: For data visualization.
  - **matplotlib**: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
  - **sklearn**: For machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression.
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the project:</p>

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```
<h3>1. Clone the repository:</h3>


```bash
git clone https://github.com/muzamil411/FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION.git
```
<h3>2.Navigate to the project directory:</h3>

```bash
cd yourprojectname
```

<h2>Usage</h2>

1.Load the dataset containing true and false news samples.

2.Preprocess the dataset by cleaning and preparing it for training.

3.Train the Logistic Regression model using the prepared dataset.

4.Provide a news headline or article as input to the model.

5.The model will predict whether the news is fake or real.
